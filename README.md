# L4D2 Dynamic SI Spawner

L4D2 Dynamic SI Spawner is an auto special infected spawner focused on more dynamic spawning. It's made to be lite and highly efficient.\
Config (dsis.cfg) should be created on the first run and located in left4dead2\cfg\sourcemod folder.

Note that some functionalities like disableling/enabeling plugin via console, disabling for versus are not implemented.

Mostly inspired by https://github.com/wyxls/SourceModPlugins-L4D2/tree/master/l4d2_autoIS_extend_cn

## Compilation
